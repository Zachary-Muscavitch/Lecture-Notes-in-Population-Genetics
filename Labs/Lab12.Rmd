# Introduction

Simulate some mother-offspring data and illustrate partitioning of variance into additive and environmental components using `rstanarm` assuming that offspring are half siblings

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

# Lab 12

As part of her [dissertation](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/1370/), Nora Mitchell measured

1. What is the heritability of each trait in each species? (3 traits, 2 species)

2. What is the estimated selection differential in each species? (3 traits, 2 species)

3. What is the predicted response to selection in each species? (3 traits, 2 species)


## Just for me while I'm getting this ready

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

rm(list = ls())

field <- read_csv("Protea_field.csv")
table(field$species)
greenhouse <- read_csv("Protea_greenhouse.csv")
table(greenhouse$species)
```
