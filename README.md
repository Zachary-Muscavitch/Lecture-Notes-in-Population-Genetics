## Lecture-Notes-in-Population-Genetics

The files here provide the <tt>LaTeX</tt> and other files I use for
producing the lecture notes I use in EEB 5348 at the University of
Connecticut:
[http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/uncommon-ground/eeb348/notes/](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/uncommon-ground/eeb348/notes/). The
<tt>LaTeX</tt> source files are licenced under a Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike license
[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Some of the
graphical artwork will also be available under the same license (when
I have time to compile a list of all files included in the CC
license). Some of the artwork is converted from published sources, and
you will find citations to those sources in the notes where the
artwork is used.

Files in the <tt>book</tt> subdirectory are either direct copies of
those in the base directory or simple conversions to allow me to
produce a single volume of notes:
[https://figshare.com/articles/Lecture_notes_in_population_genetics/100687](https://figshare.com/articles/Lecture_notes_in_population_genetics/100687). If
you use or refer to these notes, please use the DOI from Figshare to
cite them.

Files in the <tt>not maintained</tt> subdirectory are from pre-2019
editions of the course. I believe all of the EPS files referred to in
the LaTeX source are also found in this directory, but it's possible
that I've missed some. As the title of the subdirectory suggests, I'm
not maintaining these notes any more. They were useful and accurate
the last time I used them (so far as I know), but I make no promises
for them now.

Files in the <tt>Labs</tt> directory are associated with labs from
Fall 2021 onwards. They aren't compiled into the "book", but they
include all of the data and any code that's needed for the analyses -
other than the code I expect students to write themselves.

Files in the <tt>Slides</tt> directory are the LaTeX source and
associated figures for the PDF slides I use during lectures.
